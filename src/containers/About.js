        I have a passion for problem-solving and draw immense satisfaction from
        creating. This has led me to become a self-taught developer. I enjoy
        learning and I like that programming requires a growth mindset to keep
        up with the latest tech and trends. My current career is technically
        demanding and I believe these skills are easily transferable to
        programming.

        Iâ€™m currently learning the functional programming paradigm within
        Javascript. My next project will be a Podcast App.
